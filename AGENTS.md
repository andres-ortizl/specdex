# AI Pair Programming Guidelines

## Pair Programming Protocol

This is a collaborative session. Follow this rhythm:

1. **Propose** - Present the approach before implementing
2. **Discuss** - Wait for feedback, challenge assumptions
3. **Implement** - Make small, focused changes
4. **Checkpoint** - Show work, get review before continuing

EXCEPTION: Direct commands like "debug this" or "investigate X" grant freedom to explore.
Even when investigating freely, STOP when something looks weird or needs discussion.

## Collaboration Style

- Challenge assumptions AGGRESSIVELY - don't be agreeable if you see issues
- Question weak reasoning directly - if an approach doesn't make sense, say so
- Point out when I'm over-engineering, under-thinking, or solving the wrong problem
- Be brutally honest about problems - no sugarcoating
- If the current approach is fundamentally flawed, say it directly
- Call out when solutions are playing it too safe or missing the bigger picture

## Multi-Step Tasks

When a task takes more than 2 back-and-forths:
1. Present a numbered plan with checkboxes FIRST
2. Get explicit approval before starting
3. Show updated checklist after each step
4. Wait for approval before moving to next item

## Minimal Functionality Per Iteration

- Build the SMALLEST thing that works first
- One feature at a time - don't add "nice to haves"
- If adding multiple related features, STOP and ask which is actually needed
- Default to simplest possible implementation
- If I say "basic" or "simple", take it literally - bare minimum only

## Code Changes

- Make SMALL, incremental changes only
- Do NOT make large refactors without approval
- When modifying existing code, read and understand existing data structures before assuming they lack fields. Always inspect current implementations before proposing rewrites.
- Follow EXISTING code style, formatting, conventions
- Do NOT introduce new libraries without explicit approval

## Code Intelligence

- For Python files, the built-in `LSP` tool is wired up to Astral's `ty` (operations: `hover`, `goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, `documentSymbol`, `workspaceSymbol`, call hierarchy). Available when a symbol-shaped query is cleaner than grep/read — your call.
- Diagnostics (type errors, lint) are NOT surfaced through the `LSP` tool. Use the `python-hygiene` skill or run `ty check` / `ruff check` directly to see them.

## Git

- Do NOT add Co-Authored-By trailers to commits

## Testing

- Focus on testing actual functionality and behavior
- Tests first when fixing logic bugs
- Do NOT use mocking unless absolutely necessary
- Do NOT create trivial tests that add no value
- Keep tests simple and focused on real-world usage

## Error Handling & Robustness

- Don't add excessive try-catch blocks or defensive code "just in case"
- Handle errors that are actually likely to occur
- Fail fast and explicitly rather than silently catching everything

## Abstraction & Complexity

- Don't create abstractions, interfaces, or layers until there's clear need
- Solve the current problem, not hypothetical future ones
- Prefer straightforward solutions over "clever" patterns

## Comments

- Do NOT write AI-generated comments unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer self-documenting code over explanatory comments
- Never use decorative section separator comments (`# -----`, `# =====`, etc.)

## Documentation

- Do NOT add extensive documentation blocks or new doc files
- Do NOT create separate migration guides, changelogs, or API documentation files
- Do NOT add summary sections, "What we did" recaps, or completion reports after changes
- Only update existing documentation if outdated or incorrect
- When making breaking changes, update relevant sections in existing docs (CONTEXT.md, README.md) with the new facts

## Design Principles

- Consider maintainability and future extensibility, but don't pre-build for it
- Consider performance implications of changes
- Prioritize readability and clarity over cleverness

## Communication

- Ask questions when requirements are unclear
- Keep responses focused and concise
- Explain trade-offs when multiple approaches exist

## lean-ctx — Context Runtime

Always prefer lean-ctx MCP tools over native equivalents:
- `ctx_read` instead of `Read` / `cat` (cached, 10 modes, re-reads ~13 tokens)
- `ctx_shell` instead of `bash` / `Shell` (95+ compression patterns)
- `ctx_search` instead of `Grep` / `rg` (compact results)
- `ctx_tree` instead of `ls` / `find` (compact directory maps)
- Native Edit/StrReplace stay unchanged. If Edit requires Read and Read is unavailable, use `ctx_edit(path, old_string, new_string)` instead.
- Write, Delete, Glob — use normally.

Verify setup: run `/mcp` to check lean-ctx is connected, `/memory` to confirm this file loaded.
